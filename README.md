# REST-EASY-LOKI

A simple REST interface for the in-memory database, `lokijs`, featuring:

- Automatic creation of collections, including CRUD actions, pagination and MongoDB-like queries.
- Simple authorization using whitelisting domain names and API keys via environment variables.
- Statically sharing the public folder
- Retrieving environment variables starting with `LOKI_` via REST

## Development

```bash
npm install # Or pnpm i
npm start # Will transpile the TypeScript project to JavaScript and run node on every change.
```

## Usage

To simply run the `lokijs` server and expose the CRUD services.

```bash
npm run serve
```

To embed it in your own project, do something like the following:

```ts
import * as Koa from 'koa'; // You only need to include @types/koa in your devDependencies, not Koa itself.
import { createApi, db } from 'rest-easy-loki';

export const collectionName = 'documents';

const port = process.env.LOKI_PORT || '3000';
const dbName = process.env.LOKI_DB;
const cors = (process.env.LOKI_CORS || 'true') === 'true';
const sizeLimit = process.env.LOKI_SIZE_LIMIT || '25mb';

export const startService = () => {
  db.startDatabase(dbName, () => {
    const api = createApi({ cors, sizeLimit }) as Koa;
    api.listen(port);
    console.log(`Server running on port ${port}.`);
  });
};
startService();
```

### Configuration

- Reads `.env` file for specifying the database name, port, CORS and message size limits.

### Managing collections (CRUD)

- Get an overview of all collections: [https://localhost:3000/api/collections](https://localhost:3000/api/collections).
- Get all messages in a collection: [https://localhost:3000/api/COLLECTION_NAME](https://localhost:3000/api/COLLECTION_NAME).
- Automatic creation of new collections: when you post a message to a non-existing collection, it is automatically created.
- Create a new item: POST the item as an `application/json` body to [https://localhost:3000/api/COLLECTION_NAME](https://localhost:3000/api/COLLECTION_NAME).
- Get the item with `$loki` ID: [https://localhost:3000/api/COLLECTION_NAME/ID](https://localhost:3000/api/COLLECTION_NAME/1).
- Delete the item with `$loki` ID: Make a DELETE request to [https://localhost:3000/api/COLLECTION_NAME/ID](https://localhost:3000/api/COLLECTION_NAME/1).
- Update the item by ID. PUT the item as an `application/json` body to [https://localhost:3000/api/COLLECTION_NAME/ID](https://localhost:3000/api/COLLECTION_NAME/ID). Alternatively, change the original item (from the GET, so including `$loki` ID) and PUT it back to [https://localhost:3000/api/COLLECTION_NAME](https://localhost:3000/api/COLLECTION_NAME)

### Filtering collections

- Pagination of messages in a collection: [https://localhost:3000/api/COLLECTION_NAME?from=0&to=10](https://localhost:3000/api/COLLECTION_NAME?from=0&to=10).
- Query a collection using find, for example based on strict equality `q={"name": "a name"}`: [https://localhost:3000/api/COLLECTION_NAME?from=0&to=10&q=%7B%20%22name%22:%20%22My%20third%20lesson%22%20%7D](https://localhost:3000/api/COLLECTION_NAME?from=0&to=10&q=%7B%20%22name%22:%20%22My%20third%20lesson%22%20%7D)
- Another query example, not equal `q={"name": {"$ne": "a name"}}`: [https://localhost:3000/api/COLLECTION_NAME?from=0&to=10&q=%7B%20%22name%22:%20%7B%20%22$ne%22:%20%22My%20third%20lesson%22%20%7D%7D](https://localhost:3000/api/COLLECTION_NAME?from=0&to=10&q=q=%7B%20%22name%22:%20%7B%20%22$neq%22:%20%22My%20third%20lesson%22%20%7D%7D).- You can filter the properties that get returned (simple GraphQL-like filter) using a collection's 'view', e.g. [http://localhost:3000/api/COLLECTION_NAME/view?props=title,$loki,file](http://localhost:3000/api/COLLECTION_NAME/view?props=title,$loki,file).

### Sharing the public folder

- You can use the `public` folder for sharing static files or your own web application.

### Serving environment variables

- The [http://localhost:3000/api/env](http://localhost:3000/api/env) serves all environment variables that start with `LOKI_` (except the `LOKI_AUTHZ_`, so you don't accidentally share secrets). Since all key-value pairs are strings, a type conversion to boolean, number and arrays (using the , as separator) is performed.

### Authorization

- Simple authorization can be enabled by specifying environment variables: `LOKI_AUTHZ_CREATE`, `LOKI_AUTHZ_READ`, `LOKI_AUTHZ_UPDATE`, `LOKI_AUTHZ_DELETE`, where the value is a comma-separated list of API keys. If no `authz` is set, all CRUD actions are allowed. Otherwise, your query needs to set the `x-api-key` header.
- You can require it in your own project.
